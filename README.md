* For system.wide deinstallation (need administrator privileges):

## Translations ##

To update all the po files with new code changes:

`python setup.py build_i18n -u -m`

To add a new language just add it's code (ex: "it" or "en") to the LINGUAS
file present in the data/po folder of the sources and run:

`python setup.py build_i18n -m`

this will generate the new empty po file under data/po/your_code.po, you
can then edit this file to fill your translation. Don't forget to fill the
header informations, at least charset (usually UTF-8) and Plural-Forms.
